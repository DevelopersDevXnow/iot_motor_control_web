# IoT Application for Remote Motor Control
The objective of this project is to control a DC motor using an L298N motor driver and an ESP8266 NodeMCU via a webpage. The web page allows users to turn the motor on/off, adjust its speed, and set the on/off times for automated control. This project demonstrates how the internet of things (IoT) can be used to control physical devices remotely.
